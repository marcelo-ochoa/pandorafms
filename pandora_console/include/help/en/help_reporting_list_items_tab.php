<h1>Report list items</h1>

<p>With this tab you'll get a global visualization of all items that make up the report. The items in the list will be shown in the order that they'll have in the report. From this tab it's possible:</p>

<ul>
<li type="circle">To modify the item (by doing click on the adjustable spanner).</li>
<li type="circle">To modify the order in an automatic way in the header cells with the white arrows, classifying them by alphabetically element kind or by agent name.</li>
<li type="circle">To modify the order manually through the green arrows on the left.</li>
<li type="circle">To eliminate the item clicking on the red cross.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Linking modules</h1>

<p>Unlinked modules are modules that are not modified by the policy in the future. This is really useful because allow to define individual exceptions to the policy behaviour. You don't need to remove an agent if you want to change the behaviour of one module (for example, min_threshold), just unlink from the policy.</p>

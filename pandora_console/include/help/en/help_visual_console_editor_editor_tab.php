<h1>Editor</h1>

<p>This tab has most of the part of the functionality of the
visual console editor, because is where you could create the elements,
edit and place them. It is a dynamic page, so it will be necessary that
your browser support correctly the javascript languaje. As you can see
in the screen shot, the screen is divided in two areas that are well
defined:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
    <li>the button box</li>
    <li>the work area (where you will "draw" the visual console)</li>
    <li>the option palette ( that is not visible in this screen shot)</li>
</ul>
You can set the label with a rich text.
And the item "Simple value" you can use the macros to set inner the text
with (_VALUE_).

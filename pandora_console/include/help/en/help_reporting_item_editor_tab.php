<h1>Report item editor</h1>

<p>Item Editor tab is more complex than the others, because from it, you'll be able to create the form items or to edit them. Besides, the form is dynamic depending on the kind of item to create. In the edition, all the fields (expept the kind) can be edited. If you need to change the kind, the way to do this is to eliminate the current one and create it again with the same configurations.</p>

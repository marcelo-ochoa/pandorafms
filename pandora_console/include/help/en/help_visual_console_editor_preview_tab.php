<h1>Preview</h1>

<p>This tab is useful to see the result of your work in a quick way, avoiding surfing between the <?php echo get_product_name(); ?> Console menus. The visual console view is an static view, so, if the state of the elements contained there, they will not be drawing again as it happens with the visual console view that hangs on the Visual Console menu.</p>

<p>The "ReconScripts" allows to work with more flexible capabilities. The recon scripts are developped in an individual way with completely specific targets, such as the network plugins or the agent plugins. Each ReconScript is different and has one purpose.</p>

It is possible to do an script or application that does the task that are wanted and schedule its execution through the Discovery Server.</p>

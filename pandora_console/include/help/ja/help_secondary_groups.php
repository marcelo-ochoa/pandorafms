<h1>Secondary groups</h1>

<p>
Unlike the main group, these secondary groups are optional.
</p>

<p>
The fact that an agent belongs to a secondary group means that, in fact, it belongs to several groups at the same time. With this functionality, two users who have very different permissions will be able to access the same agent just by adding the appropriate secondary groups to it.
</p>

<p>
For example, if an agent named "Portal" has "Infrastructures" as its main group and "Hosting" as its secondary group, any user who has access to "Infrastructures" and/or "Hosting" can access it.
</p>

<p>
Some views, such as the Tree View, can show repeated agents. When using secondary groups, this is the normal behavior.
